# Steal My Ideas

This is a collection of ideas I'm desperate to share with the world. As much as I am completely and utterly convinced of their usefulness, I have only but one life and as such will only ever be able to convert some of them into a reality.

Hence, I mean for you to go ahead and steal as much of my ideas as possible. You don't need to give anything in return and I hereby refrain from any claims on the rights of this material: anything here can and should be considered to be part of the Public Domain.
