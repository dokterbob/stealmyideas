# Steal My Ideas

This is a collection of ideas I'm desperate to share with the world. As much as I am completely and utterly convinced of their usefulness, I have only but one life and as such will only ever be able to convert some of them into a reality.

This work is, essentially, an intermediate result of the [Decentralized Society Research Project](http://dsrp.eu) and throughout these concepts the reader might find some of the underlying principles of decentral cooperation as envisioned within the project exposed. However, at this time, there is not yet a sufficiently encompassing overview of such principles.
