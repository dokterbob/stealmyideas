# Cybernetic Optimization for Complex Systems

Generally, complex systems are artificially stabilized and optimized in the same way that linear systems are. Sometimes, higher-order components are accounted for by differentating or integrating but, overall, feedback systems are designed such as to minimize deviation from local optima at all times.

When comparing this to most naturally evolved sytems, however, we can see that they are often grown to gain from disorder; rather than requiring or assuming an environment that is consistant, they thrive and grow from unexpected perturbations. In another way, it can be said that these 'anti-fragile' systems learn.

As an increasing amount of societies processes have effectively been cybernetically regulated in one way or another, it should become increasingly apparent that this 'overfitting' has become a systemic weakness as large perturbations occur with increasingly dramatic disruptions as a consequence.

Alternatively, it shoud be possible to design control loops such as to account, specifically, the non-linearities in the dynamics by careful fuzzing of the control system. This implies the conscious injection of noise in the control signal in order to determine the degree of fragility of systems, to discover couplings between components and to create a full model of operation space of systems.
