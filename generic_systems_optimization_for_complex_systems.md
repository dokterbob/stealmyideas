# Cybernetic Optimization for Complex Systems

Generally, complex systems are artificially stabilized and optimized in the same way that linear systems are. Sometimes, higher-order components are accounted for by differentating or integrating but, overall, feedback systems are designed such as to minimize deviation from local optima at all times.
