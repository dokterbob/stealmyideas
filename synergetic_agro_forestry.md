# Synergetic Agro Forrestry
Garbage in, everything out: convert local 'wastes' into diverse, income generating forrest gardens, reducing pollution, generating fertile soil and sequestering carbon.

Use knowledge on sustainable forrestry, agriculture, fermentation, ecology and economy to create business models offsetting the yield model of monoculture wood production (such as eucalypt) as land use by a magnitude while retaining regional autonomy by stimulating local exchange networks and performing all required processes within local economies.

The latter are also the main difficulties of this concept: while not biologically or chemically necessary, fermentation and composting of diverse organic wastes is usually done at larger industrially scales. The difficulty here lies mainly in reducing the overhead in the associated monitoring and accounting processes, so that
