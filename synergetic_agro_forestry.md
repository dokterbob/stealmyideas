# Synergetic Agro Forrestry
Garbage in, everything out: convert local 'wastes' into diverse, income generating forrest gardens, reducing pollution, generating fertile soil and sequestering carbon.

Use knowledge on sustainable forrestry, agriculture, fermentation, ecology and economy to create business models offsetting the yield model of monoculture wood production (such as eucalypt) as land use by 
## Inputs
