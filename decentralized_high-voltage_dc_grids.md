# Decentralized High-Voltage DC grids
Current electricity grids are based on technology invented by Nikola Tesla, which was only ever meant as an intermediate stage before realizing a global and freely acessible energy distribution system using resonances on the earth's crest. However, due to a disease typically referred to as capitalism, his dreams were never realized and, in fact, are further from being realized then ever imagined.

Moreover, with our currently knowledge of biological systems and their electrical properties, having the whole earth continually enveloped in a very strong electromagnetic field seems like a potentially disastrous plan.

Rather than furthering the excellent work of Nikola Tesla, it makes sense to try and move forward towards a sustainable society in a way that allows 'legacy' systems to coincide with its successors, allowing for free and open competition and forcing any new systems to compete economically as well as in sustainability.

One such method would be to design a fully decentralized electrical system based on higher (~400V) DC voltages, where focus is put on local or regional energy self-sufficiency: instead of optimizing for low transport losses, optimization is done to maximize local resilience, stability and diversity. The idea is to fully decentralize the storage, production and distribution of energy such that any participant in the electrical grid performs an active role and, by material necessity, has a real but naturally limited power over the implementation of the system. In other words; participants are economically bound to cooperative participation.

However, on a larger scale, local systems *can* and should be connected to other systems, whether 'legacy' AC systems or other autonomous cooperatives. This allows for open competition between 'legacy' systems and decentralized alternatives, allowing for a smooth transition and consumer choice. 

More technically, the system would consist of high and lower voltage components, together with decentrally organized algoritms
